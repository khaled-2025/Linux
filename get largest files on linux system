Simple Bash trick to find the largest files on Disk

"find /* -type f -exec du -sh {} + | sort -hr | head -n10"

This bash command lists 10 of the largest files on your Linux system.

Explanation:

ðŸ‘‰ First, we use "find" to list all files starting at the root directory. We run "du" on them to get their sizes.
ðŸ‘‰ Next, we pipe this output to "sort" to sort all the files in descending order of size.
ðŸ‘‰ Finally, we use "head" to only display the top 10 files on the list.

It's incredible what Linux lets you do through piping and a bunch of simple commands ðŸš€
